Please note that the time for changing clothes, rearranging lights and props is included in these 30 minutes.
If you are late for shooting - the time of your photo session is reduced, you can extend the shooting only for an additional fee and only if the time after you is not busy.

A photo day is a bustle, haste, unexpected delays and incidents. It happens that everyone is late: both clients and makeup artists. Sometimes the photographer gets carried away and forgets about time. The human factor operates exponentially. You can't do without it, really.

> Remember, {{<hl>}} the main thing {{</ hl>}} is not the time! But _{{<hl>}} the photos that you will get {{</ hl>}}._ They will be incredibly beautiful IF YOU are in a good mood and relaxed, so please don't screw yourself up.
7 good photos can be taken in 5 minutes if people are positive and actively participate in the shooting.

_In general, do not think about the time, think about the mood and enjoy what is happening._
