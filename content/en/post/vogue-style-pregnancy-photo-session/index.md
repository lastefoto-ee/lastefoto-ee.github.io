Laconic, stylish, silhouette.

_ONLY YOUR BEAUTY_ ‚ù§Ô∏è

Why did I give up shooting pregnancy in studios with decorations?
Of course, the decoration is beautiful! But the VOGUE style pregnancy photo shoot focuses on you! No tinsel distracting from the divine, soft silhouettes... You will not hide behind a beautiful sofa or a chic vase of flowers ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è You will always be relevant and beautiful in your photos, unlike the decor, which goes out of fashion every couple of years.

And to be honest, it's hard for me to work with decorations. All the poses that I suggest in Vogue-style pregnancy photo sessions are difficult to combine with beds/soft chairs, etc.

Be brave, beautiful, stylish and I will help with the selection of a wardrobe, will advise a make-up artist who will highlight your beauty. ü•∞
