There are pregnancy photo shoots that are inspiring, and this is one of them.

A photo shoot of Tatyana's pregnancy inspired me to show the expectant mother from several sides, in several states. Sweet, elegant, brave, dreaming ..

Tatiana wrote to me after the photo shoot:

> I saw myself again as I was before .. pretty and cute. Even with a belly 😍

I am happy that I can give you not just "photos", but a real MEMORY of one of the most reverent periods in your life and show its beauty. ♥ ️

Remember that you are beautiful. Very! And be sure to keep this memory in photographs as well.
