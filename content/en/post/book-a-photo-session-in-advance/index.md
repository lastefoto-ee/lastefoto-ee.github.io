The recommended age for a newborn photo shoot is the first two weeks of a baby's life.

For the most part, newborn babies at this time

ðŸ¥° sleep more

ðŸ¥° it is easier to put them in a pose

ðŸ¥° they have clear skin

ðŸ¥° they are not bothered by gazes yet

Of course, you can try to sign up for the newborn photosession upon the birth of the baby (call as soon as you get well, for 2-3 days), but in this case there is a risk that due to the workload I will not have time to organize everything before 14 days.

Therefore, I strongly advise you to schedule a newborn photo session according to the PDB (preliminary date of birth), then I will have a reference point, and the chances of a quiet newborn shooting and beautiful pictures will increase significantly!
