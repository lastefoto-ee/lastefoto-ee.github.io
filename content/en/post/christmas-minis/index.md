## Who is the photo shoot for?
- This year in my New Year's photos there is no Christmas tree, Santa Claus under it and New Year's tinsel.

> Your family is the main thing on the picture! ❣️

Do you want the same? Then this photo shoot is for you!

## When will the photo shoot take place?
At any time convenient for you.

## How long is the photo shoot?
- If you have chosen a photo shoot on one background (red or gray), then we will spend about an hour together. The duration of the photo shoot itself will be 30-40 minutes. It will take 10-15 minutes to adapt and change clothes.
- If you have chosen a photo shoot using two backgrounds (red and gray), then we will spend two hours together. The duration of the photo shoot itself will be 60-90 minutes. Adaptation, dressing up, changing backgrounds and props will take 15-30 minutes.

## How much does a photo shoot cost?
- Photo shoot on a red OR gray background - 130 €
- Photo shoot on a red AND gray background - 170 €

{{< cta cta_text="Book time for a photo shoot" cta_link="/en/#contact" cta_new_tab="true" >}}

## What is included in the cost of a photo shoot?
- 10-15 retouched digital files if you choose to shoot on one background. Raw files are not included in the cost of the photo shoot
- 15-20 retouched digital files if you choose to shoot on two backgrounds. Raw files are not included in the cost of the photo shoot
- photo shoot for 1-2 hours in prepared photo zones (red and/or gray)
- clothes for babies up to 1.5-2 years old (the studio has festive dresses and bodysuits suitable for shooting)
- studio rent
