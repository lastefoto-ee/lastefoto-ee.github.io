## What is a Cake Smash photo shoot?
This is a bright photo event when a cake is made for a baby which he can do whatever he wants - crush, eat with his hands, get dirty, smear cream or just sit quietly next to him (yes-yes, this happens too). And all this fun will be captured in the photographs.

Cake smash photo shoot is full of new emotions and impressions for the baby. The baby gets tired quickly and therefore you should not plan other activities for the baby on this day.

If you will be celebrating the baby's birthday at home or in the playroom, do not schedule a photo shoot for the same day. This will be a very big emotional burden for the baby.

The presence of a large number of relatives on the photo shoot very quickly tires the child. Remember that first of all this is a baby photo shoot, and if you want pictures with grandparents, aunts, uncles, godparents, it is advisable that they arrive at the beginning or at the end of the shooting. Better yet - schedule a family photo shoot the next day.

## When to do a Cake Smash photo shoot?
A photo shoot is usually carried out not on the birthday day itself, but a few days/weeks before or after.

## What clothes to take for the birthday baby and for parents to take family shots?
I recommend bringing at least 2 sets of clothes with you. The first one is smart - for the formal part of the photo shoot, the second - which is not a pity to get dirty and/or easy to clear. It is desirable that the clothes were without large drawings and inscriptions. It can be any pastel or saturated colors that are combined with each other.
### What can I take for a girl:
- bodysuits, skirts, delicate dresses
### What can I take for a boy:
- jeans, pants, shorts, shirts, bodysuits, suspenders
### For family pictures
- jeans/trousers are best, for mom - a skirt and a plain top (t-shirts, shirts)

If you have older children, then for a photo of a baby with a brother/sister, I recommend for the boy a shirt in soothing colors and light jeans/trousers, and for the girl - a dress.

## Cake
I order the cake from my pastry chef, with whom I have been cooperating for several years. Usually it is a biscuit with curd-banana filling, mascarpone-based cream is used as a decoration.

You can bring your own cake or replace it with something else. For example, donuts.

## Balloons
I send you a palette of balloons to choose from when booking a Cake Smash photo shoot. You can choose any colors. But don't overdo it. 2-3 colors look beautiful on the photo.

## Water procedures

If the baby is not afraid of water, then after the photos with the cake, we move on to water procedures. Bring along a towel, bath foam and baby's favorite bath toys.
