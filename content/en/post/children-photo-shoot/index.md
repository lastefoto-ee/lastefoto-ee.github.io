A year and a half ago, I took a Vogue-style maternity course. I love shooting pregnancy in this minimalist style. When there is nothing superfluous on the photo: only mom and her baby. ❤️

And I wanted the same cool photos for myself. So Marta and I decided to do a similar photo shoot in my studio. I took a few shots for her, and she - for me. It was really difficult for her: in order to take the right shooting point, she had to stand on a chair. Add here the considerable weight of the camera + the weight of the lens. But she did great! ❤️

Do you want the same shots for yourself or for your grown-up baby?
