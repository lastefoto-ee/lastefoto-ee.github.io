No wonder they say that the best gift is the one that a person cannot buy for himself.

Most mothers who come to me with newborn babies admit that they themselves would hardly have decided on such a photoshoot.
In household chores, both before childbirth and after, the thought somehow does not come to mind that it would be great to keep in mind the very first days of a baby's life.

But, if there is a discerning friend/mother/sister who gives a certificate for a newborn photosession, then this, as a result, turns out to be exactly the gift that will be remembered for a lifetime.
After all, the pictures stolen from time by a professional lens are thoroughly imbued with the thrill and tenderness of the newly realized motherhood ... And they are much more valuable than diapers and rattles.

So give your beloved girls emotions, give feelings ... They are forever. ❤️
