An important event is about to happen in your family - your baby is about to turn 1. Parents usually take extra care to prepare for a baby's first birthday, because they want to make it a day of celebration for everyone close to the baby. Well, it pays to have beautiful pictures to remember, so a first birthday or Cake Smash photo session is always a hot topic.

Generally speaking, a first birthday photo session is not much different from any [baby photo shoot](https://www.lastefoto.ee/en/post/features-of-a-baby-photo-shoot/), it's just about creating a festive atmosphere that you should think about beforehand. This can be done in several ways:

## First birthday photo session's decorations

You can decorate the photo studio with balloons, artificial or fresh flowers. The birthday child will surely enjoy exploring such props, so don't count on their integrity after the photo shoot is over.

## Cake for a Cake Smash photo shoot
Cake smash is a popular 1 year old baby photo session option and a real children's treat. Indeed, when mum and dad put a whole huge cake at the child's disposal, they can do anything the child's soul desires. As happiness usually knows no bounds, the emotions at a 1-year-old's photo session are particularly sincere.

## Outfit for a Cake Smash photo session
Due to the young age of the birthday girl or boy, you should not choose complicated, heavy dresses and suits that restrict the baby's movements. Choose something light and comfortable.

A first birthday photo session does not require complicated preparation. You can do without it altogether and simply take a picture of the birthday child on their first birthday, or you can consider a photo session as a great excuse to take a special, beautiful picture of your adult child.
