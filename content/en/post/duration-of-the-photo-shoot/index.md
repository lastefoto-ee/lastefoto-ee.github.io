How long does a photo shoot take? - is the question most parents who come to me ask. The feelings and excitement of parents are understandable: long-term shooting can tire the baby.

The duration of the photo session depends on the age of the child. It is difficult to shoot a newborn and an active one-year-old baby for the same time. There will be different tactics and results.

## Newborn photo shoot: while the baby sleeps

The duration of a newborn photo shoot depends on newborn baby character, mood and many other factors. Usually the result of a photo shoot is 90% of the photos where the baby is sleeping. Of course, if the newborn does not fall asleep immediately, I am happy to take photos with eyes open.
Shooting a newborn lasts about 2-3 hours, but does not cause any discomfort to the baby, because at this moment he is sleeping sweetly.

## Photo shoot of a one-year-old baby: catch in an hour

The older the baby, the longer the periods of his wakefulness. Now a long photo session can really tire.
Therefore, at photo shoots of babies aged from several months to a year, I make the necessary shots as quickly as possible. It is difficult to shoot a one-year-old child for more than an hour. And this is provided that the baby is in a good mood. Sometimes shooting is reduced to half an hour.
But don't worry! During this time, we can make amazing shots. The main thing: _photo shoot should give the baby pleasure_. Then the smiles during the shooting will be the most real and sincere.
