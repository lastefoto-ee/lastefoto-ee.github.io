It is ve-e-ery beautiful: only a pregnant woman and her tummy...

## Laconic, stylish ‚ù§Ô∏è

As I write this, goosebumps are running down my skin: for me, however, photographing pregnancy is special.

And if it is also in an elegant Vogue style, then it's just a delight!

I signed up for online training with the founder of this direction, Sasha Bunaeva! These photos were taken as part of the training.

First homework and first light schemes. I'm happy ‚ù§Ô∏è

This is exactly the kind of photography that I really enjoy and which I want to develop and offer to future moms. üòç

There are still three homework and a diploma ahead, but now you can book a photo session in this direction. If this is your first pregnancy, then I am waiting for you if you are 20 to 27 weeks pregnant.

It will be very cool, I can already feel it! ‚ù§
