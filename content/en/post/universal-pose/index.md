All newborn photographers have a favorite pose, in which they most often lay their little models.
And I am no exception: my favorite pose on the tummy.

{{< figure src="./newborn-session-1.jpg" title="Newborn session in Tallinn" >}}

Insanely touching, with a touching deflection in the back and legs folded in a "bow", it is ideal for both near and distant shots... Photos in this pose are chosen by parents most often for printing.

But, in spite of its seemingly naturalness, it is not so easy to lay the baby in this pose. Hypertonicity, colic, and insufficient experience of the photographer can interfere.
But I always succeed.

It is especially cool when it turns out to connect the elbow with the bent knee.

But photography of newborns does not tolerate fanaticism, it requires maximum care and sensitivity. Therefore, if the baby from my third attempt does not fit into posing "according to the book", then I do not insist, but I am looking for an option that suits both of us. Moreover, the "on the tummy" pose is beautiful in any interpretation. ♥ ️
