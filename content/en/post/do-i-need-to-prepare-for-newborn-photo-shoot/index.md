New parents often think that it takes a lot of time to prepare for a newborn baby photo shoot. However, a newborn photo shoot requires very little preparation and the photos of the first days of the baby will become a real family treasure for years to come.

_What to do when preparing for a newborn baby photo shoot?_

In fact, the main task for parents is to choose a newborn photographer. It is worth to give enough time to this important matter, so it is better to do it not in the first days of the life of a baby, when you will not have time for this, but in advance - in the last weeks of pregnancy, when you can leisurely study the portfolio and think through your questions to the newborn photographer. In this case, when the baby is born, you will only have to confirm the pre-booked photo shoot date.

From there, everything will depend on the location of your newborn photo shoot. If you choose a newborn photo shoot at home, you will need to make some preparations in the room. It should be spacious (i.e. enough space to take pictures without extra things that will get in the shot), clean and warm (warm for the baby, not for the adult - by the thermal sensation of an adult it can be defined more as "hot"). Even if the photographer brings all his props with him (most often this is the case), the rest will need to be taken care of by the parents, so this option, while comfortable with minimal necessary movements, does require time and effort.

If you choose the option of a photo shoot in a studio, your only worry will be how to get there. The rest is taken care of by the newborn photographer. In this case, you just need to bring with you formula (if the baby is not breastfed), nappies and wet wipes, as well as a calm and good mood that your baby will definitely feel. Agree that this isn't much for good photos of the first days of your baby's life.

To summarise, it should be said that parents do need to make some effort when preparing for a newborn photo shoot, but it will not take much time and will certainly be worth the result.
