## Day 1 

_The first day of the workshop begins at 08:30 and ends at 17:30. Snacks and refreshments will be provided._

We will first discuss the general principles of photography, and how to work with newborns. We will set up the studio, equipment, and I will show you some important camera settings and light techniques. We will also discuss safety rules for working with newborns, and how to prepare your clients for the photo shoot.

- Camera settings
- How to prepare your clients before arrival

- Newborn safety

The photo shoot is the most important part of our workshop. I will focus on showing you how to position the baby, how to put them to sleep and how to calm them down, how to make smooth transitions between props and poses to make the session run smoothly. My goal is to teach you a workflow that will keep the time of the newborn session to a minimum. I will show you what my workflow looks like and what makes my job easier. 

**10:00** - Model 1 arrives (posing in props, on a beanbag)

The first model will have a mini photo shoot without photographing by the participants, Viktoria will show the sequence of her workflow with newborn - transitions between poses, wrapping, changing set-ups, etc. You will understand what the shooting scenario can be, how it changes, depending on the behavior of the baby, and how to make a beautiful photo session with a small amount of props.
