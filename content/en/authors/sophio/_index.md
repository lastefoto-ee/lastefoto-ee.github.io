title: Newborn Photo Shoot
role: Highly recommended! Before visiting Viktoria I had googled and checked several photographers‚Äô works but the quality and story of photos on her web-page attracted my attention. So we decided to let her be the first photographer of our little princess. During the photo shooting Viktoria has been treating our princess with care and patience. Our little model, as Viktoria called her üòÅ, went through the shooting process with least possible stress due to the diligence of the professional. Scenes in Viktoria‚Äôs cosy studio were well-prepared and she has been detail-oriented. As a result the photos ended up nicely shot. We decided to order the album as well and we have been happy about the choice. The quality of the album and photos together with its packaging has been outstanding and beautiful. It has been a wonderful experience from beginning to end. In the end I would like to highlight once again - Viktoria‚Äôs work is highly recommended! You can trust her to create a meaningful story about your little precious creatures. (c) Sophio
