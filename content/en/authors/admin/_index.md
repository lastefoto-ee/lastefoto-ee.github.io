Hi! I'm Viktoria, a newborn photographer in Tallinn, Estonia  since 2016. Mothers trust me with their newborn babies photo shoots for quite a while. I've photographed more than 500 newborn babies. A newborn photo shoot in the first two weeks of a baby's life is an amazing, incomparable type of shooting. Elegant minimalism, simplicity, and pithiness allow you to focus only on the baby. Such photos touch to the depths of the soul! I have collected the best props and original accessories from all over the world. I would also be happy to publish your photo shoot pictures in my portfolio with your permission.

See you at the photo session!
