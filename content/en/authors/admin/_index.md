Hi! I'm Viktoria - a newborn and pregnancy photographer in Tallinn, Estonia.

I have been professionally engaged in newborn photography since 2016. For sixth years mothers trust me with their newborn babies, during that time I have photographed more than 500 newborn babies.

A newborn photo session in the first two weeks of a baby's life is an amazing, incomparable type of shooting. Elegant minimalism, simplicity and pithiness allow you to focus only on the baby. Such photos touch to the depths of the soul!

I work in my newborn studio, which I have equipped taking into account all the peculiarities and nuances of shooting newborns.
Collected the best props and original accessories from all over the world.

I would also be happy to publish your photo session pictures in my portfolio with your permission.

See you at the photo session!
