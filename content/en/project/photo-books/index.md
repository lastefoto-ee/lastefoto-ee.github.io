{{< video library="true" src="fotoraamatud-tallinn.mp4" controls="yes" >}}
Premium quality photobooks are books for the true lovers of quality, style and longevity. 

All photo books are handmade by qualified and experienced professionals and printed using the latest printing techniques. I myself design the photo book and send you the finished layout for approval. 

The final cost of the photo book is calculated from the number of spreads, cover type and additions.

- the photo book cover can be made of leatherette, textile or velour (a great number of colour tints). It is also possible to make a photo cover (cardboard with lamination)
- the edge of the cover can be single or double stitching
