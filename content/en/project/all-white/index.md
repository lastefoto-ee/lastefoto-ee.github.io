> Capturing all those sweet details of your growing baby

- What is the best age for this session?

Ideally 8-9 months of age. When your baby can sit on their own, then this is normally a good time to bring them in. By this age, they often begin to show their unique personalities and it is such a beautiful time to capture photos. If ypur baby is not quite sitting up yet, don't worry, I will provide some support for them or have them laying on their back or tummy.

- What should they wear?

If you have an outfit that is all white, ideally with some sort of soft texture (lace, knitted etc), then that would be perfect. A simple white singlet or white trousers will be just fine too.  I suggest that mom also brings a white top, in the event the baby feels a bit uneasy and requires a cuddle. This way, mom can be part of the pictures if needed.

- How long will the session take?

Babies at this age do not have a long attention span so we try keep it short and sweet. I try capture what I can within 20 minutes or so but do allow 30 minutes.

- How to prepare for the session?

Ideally it would be great if your baby comes in just after or just before their nap time. Please bring some snacks and their favorite toy, if they have one. Also, if your baby enjoys a particular song or cartoon, keep it ready. We might use it to help them feel more at ease during the session.
