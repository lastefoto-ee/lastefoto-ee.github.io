## Newborn Photo shoot outside of Estonia

The price and conditions of the photo shoot are available on request.

> The birth of a child is undoubtedly one of the most wonderful events in life. Those tiny fingers and little facial features are a delight to the eyes, and it would be a mistake not to capture the very moment. It's only once they're so small and so cute. Let us capture your baby's beauty in a beautiful and artistic way.

- it is advisable to book a time for the newborn photo shoot in advance.
- newborn photo shoot takes place during the first 14 days of a baby's life, so it is essential to announce the baby's birth at the first opportunity, no matter how long you will be in the maternity hospital.
- at least one day before the photo shoot, mothers are advised not to eat the following foods: coffee, chocolate, citrus fruits, broccoli, garlic, spicy foods and nuts. Following this advice will increase the chances of a calm and sleepy baby.
- if possible, keep your baby awake for 1-2 hours before the photo shoot and feed him/her just before going to the studio.Choose clothes that are easy to remove and leave no marks. 
- please bring your baby's pacifier with you, even if you choose not to use it. Often the pacifier is the key to a successful photo shoot.
- for a family shot you will need a T-shirt/blouse/dress (for mum) in a neutral (e.g. white, grey or black) or saturated colour. Avoid long sleeves and patterns/lettering on the clothes.
- you can make tea in the studio, for longer shoots take a small snack with you.
- parents are welcome to send us their image and colour wishes, but please note that we unfortunately cannot guarantee that they will come true. All newborns are different and not all are willing to take the same poses or sleep deeply enough during the photo shoot.
- during the photo shoot, parents are also responsible for the older siblings who are in the studio.
