## I present a set of actions for Adobe Photoshop, created by me specifically for processing photos from a newborn photo shoot.

This set of 10 black and white actions for Adobe Photoshop is designed to give your photos a variety of monochrome tones that can be adapted to any image! ☺️

The set contains 10 actions, each of which has fully customizable layers and masks, allowing you to tailor the result to each image.

This set of actions has only been tested for compatibility with English-language Photoshop CC and may not work with other editing programs.

Make an initial color correction on the original image before applying one of these actions, as actions are meant to be the finishing touch.

This set of black and white actions is designed for a well-lit image and does not correct or compensate for incorrect lighting. Action results may vary depending on the original image.

Due to the digital nature and automatic download of this product, the purchase is non-refundable. In addition, the product may not be distributed or resold.
