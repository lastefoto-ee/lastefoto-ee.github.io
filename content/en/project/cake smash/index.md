> _Schedule your Cake Smash photo shoot keeping naps and bedtime in mind_

When planning a cake smash photo shoot, keep bedtime in mind. The goal of cake smash photo shoot is to capture your baby's personality, so we want to make sure they are well rested. If your baby is on a schedule and takes naps at the same time every day, I will work around that schedule. If your baby is not on a schedule but is happiest at certain times of the day, please schedule the session during that time.

> _Let your baby be a little hungry_

Although I usually advise feeding your child before a session to prevent them from being starving and grumpy, it can occasionally be helpful for cake smash photo shoot if your child is just a little bit hungry. Of course, continue to feed them, but if they are a little bit hungry when you bring them to the shoot, they may be more likely to eat the cake. When they see the cake after having just finished a full meal, they might not be as willing and ready to eat more.

> _Bring baby's favorite snack_

Have your baby's favorite food on hand if you are concerned that your child won't eat the cake right away. Whatever their "always makes them happy" food is â€” bring those with you. We can hide those little snacks in the icing or part of the cake to encourage them to really dig into that cake.
