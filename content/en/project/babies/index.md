> Children grow fast and learn new skills every day. Shaking hands, sitting up, toothless smiles and first steps. These memories will be priceless for both you and your child in the future.

- it is advisable to book a baby photo shoot in advance.
- babies from the age of 4 months who hold their head well, are happy to lie on their tummy or who sit without support are welcome to have a baby photo shoot.
- please bring snacks and familiar toys for babies to help catch their attention if needed.
- we will always do our best to make your baby smile in the photos, but be aware that even babies who laugh a lot at home can be more serious in the studio.
- for babies up to 1 year old (both boys and girls) we have cute dresses, bodysuits, shirts, pants, sweaters, etc. that can be worn during the photo shoot. For a family shoots, it is recommended to use a t-shirt /blouse/dress (for a mother) in a neutral (e.g. white, grey or black) or rich colour. Avoid long sleeves and patterns/lettering on the clothes.
- during the shoot, parents are also responsible for older siblings who are in the studio.
