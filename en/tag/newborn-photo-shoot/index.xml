Without the distractions of color, black and white images are able to focus on the details and emotion of the photograph, creating a timeless and enduring look.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Here are some tips for adding a classic touch to your newborn photography with black and white images:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Choose the right photographer: Look for a photographer who has experience with black and white newborn photography and a portfolio that showcases their skills. It&amp;rsquo;s also important to choose someone who has a gentle, patient, and nurturing demeanor, as newborns can be unpredictable.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>Plan ahead: Newborn photography sessions are typically held within the first few weeks of a baby&amp;rsquo;s life, when they are still very sleepy and pliable. It&amp;rsquo;s important to book your session as early as possible to ensure that you have a spot on the photographer&amp;rsquo;s schedule.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Consider the lighting: Black and white photography relies on contrast and lighting to create drama and interest in the image. When planning your newborn photography session, consider the lighting in the room and choose a location with natural light or well-diffused artificial light.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>Experiment with poses: There are many different poses that can be used in newborn photography, from traditional posed shots to more candid, lifestyle-type images. Experiment with different poses to find what works best for your newborn and creates the most striking black and white images.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>Focus on emotion: Black and white photography is able to focus on the emotion and detail of the photograph, so allow your newborn&amp;rsquo;s expressions and personality to shine through in the images. Capturing candid moments that show the true beauty and innocence of your newborn will create timeless and enduring photographs.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>When you think: “I photographed so many babies, I can’t be surprised by anything”.. but no 😂 Nonetheless experience allows to give incredibly beautiful shots to every family. ❣️ For all the time I worked with newborn babies, there was only one photo shoot, when I invited parents to come to the studio for the second time, because after the photo shoot I realized that there were very few shots. And it was not because I could not find an approach to the baby, and not because the Baby was worried about the tummy.. It happens. For reasons beyond anyone&amp;rsquo;s control 🤷🏻‍♀️ we did a second shoot in a couple of days and it was a great job.❣️&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Why am I writing about this 😀 if it seems to you that at photo shoots all the babies sleep sweetly and soundly, and the photographer just presses a button, know that it is not. A newborn photo shoot is a very narrow and most difficult direction in photography. Try to relax while shooting (after all, a calm mom = a calm baby 😉), enjoy the process and later the result!❣️&lt;/p>

Let&amp;rsquo;s figure it out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Doctors and newborn photographers define the so-called neonatal period in different ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-photo-shoot-in-tallinn">

&lt;h1 id="neonatal-period-for-doctors">Neonatal period for doctors&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Doctors determine the neonatal period at 28 days from the moment the baby is born. It takes so much time for a newborn baby to adapt to a new environment. It is expressed by one of the most important properties of the body - in the first four weeks of life a newborn baby usually sleeps a lot. After this period a completely different life begins - rapid development, increased activity, periods of sleep are reduced and periods of wakefulness are lengthened.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;h1 id="what-do-newborn-photographers-think">What do newborn photographers think?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>For newborn photographers the period suitable for a newborn photo shoot is usually the first two weeks of a baby&amp;rsquo;s life. &lt;em>Why so?&lt;/em> It&amp;rsquo;s simple: most often during this period the baby&amp;rsquo;s sleep is as strong and calm as possible. The baby cannot be awakened either by laying in the desired position or by changing clothes. The baby sleeps peacefully and the photographer calmly works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this does not mean that it will not be possible to photograph the baby in the next two weeks. It’s just that the duration of the photo session may increase and, perhaps, the baby will not be able to be put in all the desired poses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, a newborn photo shoot should be booked in advance, preferably in the last months of pregnancy. Or contact the newborn photographer as soon as possible after the birth.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="what-to-do-if-you-did-not-have-time-to-make-a-photo-shoot-of-a-newborn-on-time">What to do if you did not have time to make a photo shoot of a newborn on time?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>It was not possible to make a photo shoot of a newborn during the recommended period, but you still want to have newborn pictures? No problem! But do not put off the first photo shoot of your baby for an indefinite period. Keep in mind that every day your baby&amp;rsquo;s sleep becomes more and more sensitive. In addition, colic may begin to bother the baby. Therefore, if you have booked a photo shoot for a approximately one month old baby it is best to act according to the situation during the photo shoot. You can plan the set-ups and discuss the desired poses with the newborn photographer, but, unfortunately, the photographer cannot give guarantees that everything planned will be realized. The best solution would be to abandon difficult poses and shoot based on the mood of the small model. In this case there will be less expectations and the atmosphere at the photo shoot will be more comfortable so you will certainly get many beautiful photos.&lt;/p>

The feelings and excitement of parents are understandable: long-term shooting can tire the baby.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The duration of the photo session depends on the age of the child. It is difficult to shoot a newborn and an active one-year-old baby for the same time. There will be different tactics and results.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-photo-shoot-in-tallinn">

&lt;h2 id="newborn-photo-shoot-while-the-baby-sleeps">Newborn photo shoot: while the baby sleeps&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The duration of a newborn photo shoot depends on newborn baby character, mood and many other factors. Usually the result of a photo shoot is 90% of the photos where the baby is sleeping. Of course, if the newborn does not fall asleep immediately, I am happy to take photos with eyes open.
Shooting a newborn lasts about 2-3 hours, but does not cause any discomfort to the baby, because at this moment he is sleeping sweetly.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="photo-shoot-of-a-one-year-old-baby-catch-in-an-hour">Photo shoot of a one-year-old baby: catch in an hour&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The older the baby, the longer the periods of his wakefulness. Now a long photo session can really tire.
Therefore, at photo shoots of babies aged from several months to a year, I make the necessary shots as quickly as possible. It is difficult to shoot a one-year-old child for more than an hour. And this is provided that the baby is in a good mood. Sometimes shooting is reduced to half an hour.
But don&amp;rsquo;t worry! During this time, we can make amazing shots. The main thing: &lt;em>photo shoot should give the baby pleasure&lt;/em>. Then the smiles during the shooting will be the most real and sincere.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For the most part, newborn babies at this time&lt;/p>
&lt;p>🥰 sleep more&lt;/p>
&lt;p>🥰 it is easier to put them in a pose&lt;/p>
&lt;p>🥰 they have clear skin&lt;/p>
&lt;p>🥰 they are not bothered by gazes yet&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Of course, you can try to sign up for the newborn photo shoot upon the birth of the baby (call as soon as you get well, for 2-3 days), but in this case there is a risk that due to the workload I will not have time to organize everything before 14 days.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Therefore, I strongly advise you to schedule a newborn photo shoot according to the PDB (preliminary date of birth), then I will have a reference point, and the chances of a quiet newborn shooting and beautiful pictures will increase significantly!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Most mothers who come to me with newborn babies admit that they themselves would hardly have decided on such a photoshoot.
In household chores, both before childbirth and after, the thought somehow does not come to mind that it would be great to keep in mind the very first days of a baby&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But, if there is a discerning friend/mother/sister who gives a certificate for a newborn photo shoot, then this, as a result, turns out to be exactly the gift that will be remembered for a lifetime.
After all, the pictures stolen from time by a professional lens are thoroughly imbued with the thrill and tenderness of the newly realized motherhood &amp;hellip; And they are much more valuable than diapers and rattles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-1.jpg" alt="newborn photo shoot" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before the newborn session, parents receive a questionnaire from me, one of the points of which is the choice of the color in which the newborn photo shoot will take place. I have fifteen of them to choose from, both for boys and girls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-2.jpg" alt="newborn photo shoot in Tallinn" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It would seem that everything is simple: the color of my husband&amp;rsquo;s favorite football team is red, I also always liked this color: energetic, bright &amp;hellip; take it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-3.jpg" alt="newborn session in Tallinn" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BUT.
Will scarlet pictures fit into the interior of your home?
And if the baby was born with a distinctly reddish skin tone, are you sure you want to further accentuate it with items of clothing and props? Or, nevertheless, on the contrary, is it better to level this redness with green?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-4.jpg" alt="newborn session in the studio" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are such subtleties that you cannot immediately think of.
But now that you know about them, what color would you choose? Classic blue/pink? Or something more extravagant?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

The newborn photography market is developing very quickly and a large number of photographers offer their services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>How not to be mistaken with the choice?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After all, you do not just choose a photographer, you choose a specialist who will make a photo shoot professionally and safely for the baby.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-1.jpg" alt="newborn photo shoot" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Start looking for your photographer while you are pregnant. When the baby is born, you simply will not have time for this. And the ideal time (4-15 days) for a photo shoot of a newborn passes imperceptibly.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-2.jpg" alt="newborn photo shoot in Tallinn" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Choose a photographer who specializes in newborn photography. Browse through the portfolio. If necessary, ask a photographer to show you a series of photo shoots so you can better understand if a particular style of photography is right for you.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-3.jpg" alt="newborn session in Tallinn" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Read reviews from other customers. Ask how long the photographer has specialized in newborn photoshoots, where and from whom he studied.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-4.jpg" alt="newborn photo shoot in Tallinn" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t choose a photographer based solely on the price of a photo shoot. The price of a newborn photo shoot cannot be low - in addition to the necessary props, which must be purchased and prepared for the photo shoot, a professional newborn photographer must study a lot in order not only to please you with beautiful pictures, but also to ensure the safety of your baby during the photo shoot. Safety is the most important thing in a newborn photo shoot.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Of course, the price of a newborn photo shoot is very important, but don&amp;rsquo;t make it the main criterion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-5.jpg" alt="newborn session in the studio" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Choose a photographer for your baby, who will give you pictures, looking at which you will remember how tiny your baby was, how thin his fingers were and how you wanted to kiss his sweet toes. ❤️&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
