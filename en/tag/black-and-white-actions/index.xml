&lt;p>Here are some tips for adding a classic touch to your newborn photography with black and white images:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Choose the right photographer: Look for a photographer who has experience with black and white newborn photography and a portfolio that showcases their skills. It&amp;rsquo;s also important to choose someone who has a gentle, patient, and nurturing demeanor, as newborns can be unpredictable.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;li>Plan ahead: Newborn photography sessions are typically held within the first few weeks of a baby&amp;rsquo;s life, when they are still very sleepy and pliable. It&amp;rsquo;s important to book your session as early as possible to ensure that you have a spot on the photographer&amp;rsquo;s schedule.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Consider the lighting: Black and white photography relies on contrast and lighting to create drama and interest in the image. When planning your newborn photography session, consider the lighting in the room and choose a location with natural light or well-diffused artificial light.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
