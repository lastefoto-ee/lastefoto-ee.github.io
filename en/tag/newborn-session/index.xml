&lt;p>Here are some tips for adding a classic touch to your newborn photography with black and white images:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Choose the right photographer: Look for a photographer who has experience with black and white newborn photography and a portfolio that showcases their skills. It&amp;rsquo;s also important to choose someone who has a gentle, patient, and nurturing demeanor, as newborns can be unpredictable.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>Plan ahead: Newborn photography sessions are typically held within the first few weeks of a baby&amp;rsquo;s life, when they are still very sleepy and pliable. It&amp;rsquo;s important to book your session as early as possible to ensure that you have a spot on the photographer&amp;rsquo;s schedule.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Consider the lighting: Black and white photography relies on contrast and lighting to create drama and interest in the image. When planning your newborn photography session, consider the lighting in the room and choose a location with natural light or well-diffused artificial light.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

Experiment with different poses to find what works best for your newborn and creates the most striking black and white images.&lt;/li>

&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>Focus on emotion: Black and white photography is able to focus on the emotion and detail of the photograph, so allow your newborn&amp;rsquo;s expressions and personality to shine through in the images. Capturing candid moments that show the true beauty and innocence of your newborn will create timeless and enduring photographs.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;li>Incorporate props with texture: Black and white photography is able to highlight texture and detail, so consider incorporating props with texture into your newborn photographs. This might include blankets, wraps, or baskets with intricate patterns or textures.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>When you think: “I photographed so many babies, I can’t be surprised by anything”.. but no 😂 Nonetheless experience allows to give incredibly beautiful shots to every family. ❣️ For all the time I worked with newborn babies, there was only one photo shoot, when I invited parents to come to the studio for the second time, because after the photo shoot I realized that there were very few shots. And it was not because I could not find an approach to the baby, and not because the Baby was worried about the tummy.. It happens. For reasons beyond anyone&amp;rsquo;s control 🤷🏻‍♀️ we did a second shoot in a couple of days and it was a great job.❣️&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Why am I writing about this 😀 if it seems to you that at photo shoots all the babies sleep sweetly and soundly, and the photographer just presses a button, know that it is not. A newborn photo shoot is a very narrow and most difficult direction in photography. Try to relax while shooting (after all, a calm mom = a calm baby 😉), enjoy the process and later the result!❣️&lt;/p>

Let&amp;rsquo;s figure it out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Doctors and newborn photographers define the so-called neonatal period in different ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-photo-shoot-in-tallinn">
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photo-shoot-1.jpg" alt="Newborn photo shoot in Tallinn" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;h1 id="neonatal-period-for-doctors">Neonatal period for doctors&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Doctors determine the neonatal period at 28 days from the moment the baby is born. It takes so much time for a newborn baby to adapt to a new environment. It is expressed by one of the most important properties of the body - in the first four weeks of life a newborn baby usually sleeps a lot. After this period a completely different life begins - rapid development, increased activity, periods of sleep are reduced and periods of wakefulness are lengthened.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-photo-shoot">
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photo-shoot-2.jpg" alt="Newborn photo shoot" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;h1 id="what-do-newborn-photographers-think">What do newborn photographers think?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>For newborn photographers the period suitable for a newborn photo shoot is usually the first two weeks of a baby&amp;rsquo;s life. &lt;em>Why so?&lt;/em> It&amp;rsquo;s simple: most often during this period the baby&amp;rsquo;s sleep is as strong and calm as possible. The baby cannot be awakened either by laying in the desired position or by changing clothes. The baby sleeps peacefully and the photographer calmly works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this does not mean that it will not be possible to photograph the baby in the next two weeks. It’s just that the duration of the photo session may increase and, perhaps, the baby will not be able to be put in all the desired poses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, a newborn photo shoot should be booked in advance, preferably in the last months of pregnancy. Or contact the newborn photographer as soon as possible after the birth.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It was not possible to make a photo shoot of a newborn during the recommended period, but you still want to have newborn pictures? No problem! But do not put off the first photo shoot of your baby for an indefinite period. Keep in mind that every day your baby&amp;rsquo;s sleep becomes more and more sensitive. In addition, colic may begin to bother the baby. Therefore, if you have booked a photo shoot for a approximately one month old baby it is best to act according to the situation during the photo shoot. You can plan the set-ups and discuss the desired poses with the newborn photographer, but, unfortunately, the photographer cannot give guarantees that everything planned will be realized. The best solution would be to abandon difficult poses and shoot based on the mood of the small model. In this case there will be less expectations and the atmosphere at the photo shoot will be more comfortable so you will certainly get many beautiful photos.&lt;/p>

And I am no exception: my favorite pose on the tummy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Insanely touching, with a touching deflection in the back and legs folded in a &amp;ldquo;bow&amp;rdquo;, it is ideal for both near and distant shots&amp;hellip; Photos in this pose are chosen by parents most often for printing.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;p>But, in spite of its seemingly naturalness, it is not so easy to lay the baby in this pose. Hypertonicity, colic, and insufficient experience of the photographer can interfere.
But I always succeed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is especially cool when it turns out to connect the elbow with the bent knee.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>But photography of newborns does not tolerate fanaticism, it requires maximum care and sensitivity. Therefore, if the baby from my third attempt does not fit into posing &amp;ldquo;according to the book&amp;rdquo;, then I do not insist, but I am looking for an option that suits both of us. Moreover, the &amp;ldquo;on the tummy&amp;rdquo; pose is beautiful in any interpretation. ♥ ️&lt;/p>
