&lt;p>This set of 10 black and white actions for Adobe Photoshop is designed to give your photos a variety of monochrome tones that can be adapted to any image! ☺️&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The set contains 10 actions, each of which has fully customizable layers and masks, allowing you to tailor the result to each image.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This set of actions has only been tested for compatibility with English-language Photoshop CC and may not work with other editing programs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Make an initial color correction on the original image before applying one of these actions, as actions are meant to be the finishing touch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This set of black and white actions is designed for a well-lit image and does not correct or compensate for incorrect lighting. Action results may vary depending on the original image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to the digital nature and automatic download of this product, the purchase is non-refundable. In addition, the product may not be distributed or resold.&lt;/p>
