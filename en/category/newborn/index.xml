Yes, the range of shops of baby products today is unusually wide, but to find exactly what young parents will love and use is still a challenge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, from any clothes, toys and other similar things the baby will very quickly grow up, because the little ones always do it with just a cosmic speed, and the ideal gift for such an event should be a real family value, which will remain in the family for many years. An excellent solution in this case will be a gift certificate for a newborn photo shoot, which is sure to be appreciated by the whole family.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="a-gift-certificate-for-a-photo-shoot-for-a-newborn-or-an-older-baby-is-the-perfect-gift-for-a-babys-birth">A gift certificate for a photo shoot for a newborn or an older baby is the perfect gift for a baby&amp;rsquo;s birth&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>A gift certificate becomes a truly useful gift, as parents can choose when to use the certificate and under what conditions it is best to do so. Some families want the first ever photo shoot of the baby was certainly at home, others will be more comfortable to use a specialized photo studio. Such freedom of choice is quite possible, as well as various options for presenting finished photographs, making the baby&amp;rsquo;s first photo book and other options, which are limited only by the nominal value of the gift certificate. It is the maximum flexibility of using a gift certificate that makes it the best gift for a family with a little one - as the certificate can be valid up to one year.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="gift-for-the-birth-of-a-baby-surprise-or-no-surprise">Gift for the birth of a baby: surprise or no surprise?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Particular attention should be paid to whether there is a need to make a gift for the birth of a baby as a surprise, or still worth to discuss in advance with the parents your desire to present a certificate for a photo shoot. In order to avoid unpleasant situations, it is better to inform parents-to-be about your wish, and there are several reasons for that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, you should make sure that the family you plan to gift does not mind having a photo shoot for their newborn baby. This type of photography is becoming more and more popular, but unfortunately, even today many parents deprive themselves of the very first pictures of their baby, following traditions and superstitions. In this case, a gift certificate will only bring disappointment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second reason is the organisation of the process: if you want to make a surprise, the givers, unaware of your intention, may themselves book a newborn photo shoot with another newborn photographer. And the date with the chosen photographer is better to discuss in advance, so there is less risk that when the baby is born, there will be no empty spots in the schedule. That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s best to discuss such a birth gift in advance.&lt;/p>

However, a newborn photo shoot requires very little preparation and the photos of the first days of the baby will become a real family treasure for years to come.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-photo-shoot-in-the-studio">

&lt;p>&lt;em>What to do when preparing for a newborn baby photo shoot?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, the main task for parents is to choose a newborn photographer. It is worth to give enough time to this important matter, so it is better to do it not in the first days of the life of a baby, when you will not have time for this, but in advance - in the last weeks of pregnancy, when you can leisurely study the portfolio and think through your questions to the newborn photographer. In this case, when the baby is born, you will only have to confirm the pre-booked photo shoot date.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-photo-shoot-in-tallinn">
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>From there, everything will depend on the location of your newborn photo shoot. If you choose a newborn photo shoot at home, you will need to make some preparations in the room. It should be spacious (i.e. enough space to take pictures without extra things that will get in the shot), clean and warm (warm for the baby, not for the adult - by the thermal sensation of an adult it can be defined more as &amp;ldquo;hot&amp;rdquo;). Even if the photographer brings all his props with him (most often this is the case), the rest will need to be taken care of by the parents, so this option, while comfortable with minimal necessary movements, does require time and effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-photo-shoot">
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>If you choose the option of a photo shoot in a studio, your only worry will be how to get there. The rest is taken care of by the newborn photographer. In this case, you just need to bring with you formula (if the baby is not breastfed), nappies and wet wipes, as well as a calm and good mood that your baby will definitely feel. Agree that this isn&amp;rsquo;t much for good photos of the first days of your baby&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/p>

Without the distractions of color, black and white images are able to focus on the details and emotion of the photograph, creating a timeless and enduring look.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-photo-shoot-in-the-studio-in-tallinn">

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Here are some tips for adding a classic touch to your newborn photography with black and white images:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Choose the right newborn photographer: Look for a newborn photographer who has experience with black and white photography and a portfolio that showcases their skills. It&amp;rsquo;s also important to choose a newborn photographer who has a gentle, patient, and nurturing demeanor, as newborns can be unpredictable.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>Plan a newborn photo shoot ahead: Newborn photography sessions are typically held within the first few weeks of a baby&amp;rsquo;s life, when they are still very sleepy and pliable. It&amp;rsquo;s important to book your newborn session as early as possible to ensure that you have a spot on the photographer&amp;rsquo;s schedule.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;figure id="figure-family-photo-shoot-with-newborn-in-the-studio-in-tallinn">

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Consider the lighting: Black and white photography relies on contrast and lighting to create drama and interest in the image. When planning your newborn photography session, consider the lighting in the room and choose a location with natural light or well-diffused artificial light.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>Experiment with poses: There are many different poses that can be used in newborn photography, from traditional posed shots to more candid, lifestyle-type images. Experiment with different poses to find what works best for newborn and creates the most striking black and white images.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>Focus on emotion: Black and white photography is able to focus on the emotion and detail of the photograph, so allow your newborn&amp;rsquo;s expressions and personality to shine through in the images. Capturing candid moments that show the true beauty and innocence of your newborn will create timeless and enduring photographs.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Incorporate props with texture: Black and white photography is able to highlight texture and detail, so consider incorporating props with texture into your newborn photographs. This might include blankets, wraps, or baskets with intricate patterns or textures.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>When you think: “I photographed so many babies, I can’t be surprised by anything”.. but no 😂 Nonetheless experience allows to give incredibly beautiful shots to every family. ❣️ For all the time I worked with newborn babies, there was only one photo shoot, when I invited parents to come to the studio for the second time, because after the photo shoot I realized that there were very few shots. And it was not because I could not find an approach to the baby, and not because the Baby was worried about the tummy.. It happens. For reasons beyond anyone&amp;rsquo;s control 🤷🏻‍♀️ we did a second shoot in a couple of days and it was a great job.❣️&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Why am I writing about this 😀 if it seems to you that at photo shoots all the babies sleep sweetly and soundly, and the photographer just presses a button, know that it is not. A newborn photo shoot is a very narrow and most difficult direction in photography. Try to relax while shooting (after all, a calm mom = a calm baby 😉), enjoy the process and later the result!❣️&lt;/p>

Let&amp;rsquo;s figure it out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Doctors and newborn photographers define the so-called neonatal period in different ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-photo-shoot-in-tallinn">
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photo-shoot-1.jpg" alt="Newborn photo shoot in Tallinn" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>
Newborn photo shoot in Tallinn
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;h1 id="neonatal-period-for-doctors">Neonatal period for doctors&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Doctors determine the neonatal period at 28 days from the moment the baby is born. It takes so much time for a newborn baby to adapt to a new environment. It is expressed by one of the most important properties of the body - in the first four weeks of life a newborn baby usually sleeps a lot. After this period a completely different life begins - rapid development, increased activity, periods of sleep are reduced and periods of wakefulness are lengthened.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-photo-shoot">
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photo-shoot-2.jpg" alt="Newborn photo shoot" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;h1 id="what-do-newborn-photographers-think">What do newborn photographers think?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>For newborn photographers the period suitable for a newborn photo shoot is usually the first two weeks of a baby&amp;rsquo;s life. &lt;em>Why so?&lt;/em> It&amp;rsquo;s simple: most often during this period the baby&amp;rsquo;s sleep is as strong and calm as possible. The baby cannot be awakened either by laying in the desired position or by changing clothes. The baby sleeps peacefully and the photographer calmly works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this does not mean that it will not be possible to photograph the baby in the next two weeks. It’s just that the duration of the photo session may increase and, perhaps, the baby will not be able to be put in all the desired poses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, a newborn photo shoot should be booked in advance, preferably in the last months of pregnancy. Or contact the newborn photographer as soon as possible after the birth.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It was not possible to make a photo shoot of a newborn during the recommended period, but you still want to have newborn pictures? No problem! But do not put off the first photo shoot of your baby for an indefinite period. Keep in mind that every day your baby&amp;rsquo;s sleep becomes more and more sensitive. In addition, colic may begin to bother the baby. Therefore, if you have booked a photo shoot for a approximately one month old baby it is best to act according to the situation during the photo shoot. You can plan the set-ups and discuss the desired poses with the newborn photographer, but, unfortunately, the photographer cannot give guarantees that everything planned will be realized. The best solution would be to abandon difficult poses and shoot based on the mood of the small model. In this case there will be less expectations and the atmosphere at the photo shoot will be more comfortable so you will certainly get many beautiful photos.&lt;/p>

The feelings and excitement of parents are understandable: long-term shooting can tire the baby.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The duration of the photo session depends on the age of the child. It is difficult to shoot a newborn and an active one-year-old baby for the same time. There will be different tactics and results.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The duration of a newborn photo shoot depends on newborn baby character, mood and many other factors. Usually the result of a photo shoot is 90% of the photos where the baby is sleeping. Of course, if the newborn does not fall asleep immediately, I am happy to take photos with eyes open.
Shooting a newborn lasts about 2-3 hours, but does not cause any discomfort to the baby, because at this moment he is sleeping sweetly.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The older the baby, the longer the periods of his wakefulness. Now a long photo session can really tire.
Therefore, at photo shoots of babies aged from several months to a year, I make the necessary shots as quickly as possible. It is difficult to shoot a one-year-old child for more than an hour. And this is provided that the baby is in a good mood. Sometimes shooting is reduced to half an hour.
But don&amp;rsquo;t worry! During this time, we can make amazing shots. The main thing: &lt;em>photo shoot should give the baby pleasure&lt;/em>. Then the smiles during the shooting will be the most real and sincere.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For the most part, newborn babies at this time&lt;/p>
&lt;p>🥰 sleep more&lt;/p>
&lt;p>🥰 it is easier to put them in a pose&lt;/p>
&lt;p>🥰 they have clear skin&lt;/p>
&lt;p>🥰 they are not bothered by gazes yet&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Of course, you can try to sign up for the newborn photo shoot upon the birth of the baby (call as soon as you get well, for 2-3 days), but in this case there is a risk that due to the workload I will not have time to organize everything before 14 days.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;p>Therefore, I strongly advise you to schedule a newborn photo shoot according to the PDB (preliminary date of birth), then I will have a reference point, and the chances of a quiet newborn shooting and beautiful pictures will increase significantly!&lt;/p>

And I am no exception: my favorite pose on the tummy.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-session-in-tallinn">

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Insanely touching, with a touching deflection in the back and legs folded in a &amp;ldquo;bow&amp;rdquo;, it is ideal for both near and distant shots&amp;hellip; Photos in this pose are chosen by parents most often for printing.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>But, in spite of its seemingly naturalness, it is not so easy to lay the baby in this pose. Hypertonicity, colic, and insufficient experience of the photographer can interfere.
But I always succeed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is especially cool when it turns out to connect the elbow with the bent knee.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;p>But photography of newborns does not tolerate fanaticism, it requires maximum care and sensitivity. Therefore, if the baby from my third attempt does not fit into posing &amp;ldquo;according to the book&amp;rdquo;, then I do not insist, but I am looking for an option that suits both of us. Moreover, the &amp;ldquo;on the tummy&amp;rdquo; pose is beautiful in any interpretation. ♥ ️&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Most mothers who come to me with newborn babies admit that they themselves would hardly have decided on such a photoshoot.
In household chores, both before childbirth and after, the thought somehow does not come to mind that it would be great to keep in mind the very first days of a baby&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;p>But, if there is a discerning friend/mother/sister who gives a certificate for a newborn photo shoot, then this, as a result, turns out to be exactly the gift that will be remembered for a lifetime.
After all, the pictures stolen from time by a professional lens are thoroughly imbued with the thrill and tenderness of the newly realized motherhood &amp;hellip; And they are much more valuable than diapers and rattles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-1.jpg" alt="newborn photo shoot" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before the newborn session, parents receive a questionnaire from me, one of the points of which is the choice of the color in which the newborn photo shoot will take place. I have fifteen of them to choose from, both for boys and girls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-2.jpg" alt="newborn photo shoot in Tallinn" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It would seem that everything is simple: the color of my husband&amp;rsquo;s favorite football team is red, I also always liked this color: energetic, bright &amp;hellip; take it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-3.jpg" alt="newborn session in Tallinn" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BUT.
Will scarlet pictures fit into the interior of your home?
And if the baby was born with a distinctly reddish skin tone, are you sure you want to further accentuate it with items of clothing and props? Or, nevertheless, on the contrary, is it better to level this redness with green?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-4.jpg" alt="newborn session in the studio" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are such subtleties that you cannot immediately think of.
But now that you know about them, what color would you choose? Classic blue/pink? Or something more extravagant?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

The newborn photography market is developing very quickly and a large number of photographers offer their services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>How not to be mistaken with the choice?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After all, you do not just choose a photographer, you choose a specialist who will make a photo shoot professionally and safely for the baby.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-1.jpg" alt="newborn photo shoot" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Start looking for your photographer while you are pregnant. When the baby is born, you simply will not have time for this. And the ideal time (4-15 days) for a photo shoot of a newborn passes imperceptibly.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-2.jpg" alt="newborn photo shoot in Tallinn" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Choose a photographer who specializes in newborn photography. Browse through the portfolio. If necessary, ask a photographer to show you a series of photo shoots so you can better understand if a particular style of photography is right for you.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-3.jpg" alt="newborn session in Tallinn" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Read reviews from other customers. Ask how long the photographer has specialized in newborn photoshoots, where and from whom he studied.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-4.jpg" alt="newborn photo shoot in Tallinn" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t choose a photographer based solely on the price of a photo shoot. The price of a newborn photo shoot cannot be low - in addition to the necessary props, which must be purchased and prepared for the photo shoot, a professional newborn photographer must study a lot in order not only to please you with beautiful pictures, but also to ensure the safety of your baby during the photo shoot. Safety is the most important thing in a newborn photo shoot.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Of course, the price of a newborn photo shoot is very important, but don&amp;rsquo;t make it the main criterion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-5.jpg" alt="newborn session in the studio" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Choose a photographer for your baby, who will give you pictures, looking at which you will remember how tiny your baby was, how thin his fingers were and how you wanted to kiss his sweet toes. ❤️&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
